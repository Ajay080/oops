we use java interfaces

Interfaces basically contains abstract functions
no body of the function is allowed

Bydefault the functions are public and abstract in interfaces

and

variables are static and final bydefault in interfaces,
you cant change it, using object



Interface define what the class is doing, not how it is doing it
